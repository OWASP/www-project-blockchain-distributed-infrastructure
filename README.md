# Welcome to the blockchain distributed infrastructure ( BDI ) 

We are writing a bests pratics for blockchains projects  and a comprehensive guide that covers the processes, techniques, cases of use.
we will produce extensive documentation on best practices, to make the lay public aware, to be a tool for auditors, for developers and enthusiasts.


# Description

The project idea is to talk about which measures are motivated in open source blockchain projects, 
which of these measures are effective? which are useful for other projects? which flaws can be exploited in production, 
which flaws are not applicable or just theoretical.

# Contributors

Above all, be respectful of everyone who contributes to the project:\ 
contribute by reporting bugs you found in cryptocurrency, blockchain, DaG or DLT projects.

hash with the evidence.\
bug type: mainnet | testnet | theoretical | not tested
